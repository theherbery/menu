									Wedding Cake, also known as "Triangle Mints #23," is a potent type of indica-hybrid
									marijuana strain made by crossing Triangle Kush with Animal Mints. Fun fact: In
									Canada, this
									strain is known as Pink Cookies. The Wedding Cake strain provides relaxing and
									euphoric
									effects that calm the body and mind.<br /><br /> This strain yields a rich and tangy
									flavor
									profile with
									undertones of earthy pepper. Medical marijuana patients choose Wedding Cake to help
									relieve
									symptoms associated with pain, insomnia and appetite loss. Consumers with a low THC
									tolerance should enjoy this strain with an extra slice of care due to its high THC
									content.
									Wedding Cake has soared in popularity over the years and was named Leafly Strain of
									the Year
									in 2019.

									Papaya Punch is an Indica-leaning hybrid (60% Indica and 40% Sativa) created by
									crossing
									Papaya and Purple Punch bred by Diem Farms. The strain is best known for its calming
									high desired by many users to unwind and chill after a long day. Papaya Punch has an
									average THC of 22%, but some growers have reported as high as 29% THC from this
									strain.<br /><br />
									This marijuana strain has high levels of limonene and linalool terpenes, which give
									it a
									delicious taste of sweet tropical berry. Its flavor also has a spicy note on the
									exhale.
									Papaya Punch aroma takes after its flavor. You can expect cheesy, fruity, and
									tropical
									fragrances from the buds with earthy undertones.
									Papaya Punch certainly lives up to both words of its name. Not only is it
									high-flying,
									sweet and fruity, but it packs an incredible punch, with THC levels nearing 30% on
									the
									top end. Its dominant terpenes impart a delicious tropical flavor without making you
									feel too elevated or “racy.” In fact, you will probably be heavy on this strain,
									cemented
									bodily to your big comfy couch and ready to not move for a while.<br /><br />

									Some Sativa-dominant varieties include genetics from Cinderella 99, Jack Herer, and
									Skunk #1. However, Dinafem Seeds offers an Original Amnesia, which may include
									genetics
									from Haze, Skunk No. 1, and Northern Lights.

									To make matters more confusing, an Indica-dominant variety also exists. The
									Indica-dominant herb is a cross between Bubble Gum and Super Silver
									Haze.<br /><br />

									Several other strains under the same moniker exist as well. If possible, it is
									recommended that consumers ask their budtender for information on the variety of
									this
									flower they are offering.

									As mentioned, consumers are more likely to run into a Sativa-dominant strain. A
									popular
									European strain, this is a dreamy herb that has a reputation for inspiring fits of
									hazy,
									euphoric delight.<br /><br />

									The buds of Alien Cookies are small and chunky; their color varies from bright to
									forest
									green, covered in abundance of light orange pistils, complemented by a thick coat of
									amber trichomes.

									The smell of this strain is heavy with dank, fruity, and muted vanilla notes. The
									flavor
									is surprisingly sweet, but earthy, vanilla here is very distinct, also known to have
									a
									hint of citrus. Being an evenly balanced strain, Alien Cookies is the best of both
									worlds
									(Sativa and Indica) when it comes to talking about its powerful effects.

									It is very tender in the beginning, providing users with happy, euphoric, uplifting
									experience, perfect for social events, however as the effects progress, it takes you
									into a profoundly relaxed, even sedated state. Alien Cookies is also known to invoke
									intense munchies. Several users reported it to be helpful in a condition such as
									loss of
									appetite. Novice users should take caution while using this strain, as, if taken too
									much, it takes you straight to deep sleep. This strain has an amazing ability to
									relax
									the body and calm the mind.<br /><br />

									The strain dedicated to Franco, that would represent him the best is his very last

									Medicinally
									effective in pain therapy, appetite stimulation and against insomnia.
									<br /><br />
									The plant develops a medium-sized structure with wide and long branches that need
									support. It is ideal for LST and SCRoG techniques. The harvest comes after 9-11
									weeks of
									flowering and brings impressive yields of 750gr/m2 indoors and up to 1000gr/plant
									outdoors. Equatorial, tropical, subtropical and temperate climates are the best for
									outside
									growing. The smoke brings unforgettable tastes of citrus and cheese and energetic,
									social
									effects. Franco's Lemon Cheese is a good remedy for pain relieve and appetite
									stimulation.<br /><br />

									G13 Haze cannabis seeds by Barney's Farm belong to a Sativa-dominant, feminized
									cannabis strain derived from the cross of the world-renowned G13 and a Hawaiian
									Sativa. The result is a vigorous, potent and easy-to-grow hybrid whose heavy-yield
									will disappoint no one.<br /><br />
									G13 Haze grows beautiful medium-sized marijuana plants with a resistant structure
									and plenty of buds overflowing with resin. It adapts perfectly to SOG and SCROG
									cultivation systems.
									The flavour and aroma of G13 Haze are intense and fruity, with hints of acid and
									touches of exotic wood as well as spices. The effect is powerful, cerebral,
									invigorating and euphoria producing. Ideal to boost creativity.<br /><br />

									The indica cannabis strain dubbed Double OG produces a scent and taste reminiscent
									of a skunky garden, being slightly sweet, a bit sour, and all with undertones of
									fresh earth. Its harvest-ready nugs are light green and lumpy, with orangey pistils
									laced throughout.<br /><br />

									THC levels of Double OG average around 22-24%, with some crops reaping in at 32%!
									Its high is known to be quite potent, so novice consumers take heed. The mind and
									body will fall into a deep relaxation that often leads to couch-lock. Functioning
									will not come easy, so ensure all important tasks of the day have been completed.
									The
									head-high will progress into a deep stone, allowing the body to fall asleep
									easily.<br /><br />

									Bruce Banner #3, also known as "BB3" and "Bruce Banner 3," is a hybrid weed strain
									bred by crossing OG Kush with Strawberry Diesel. Consumers who have smoked Bruce
									Banner #3 say the effects come on quickly and feel creative, euphoric, and
									energetic.<br /><br />

									Medical patients who choose this strain say it helps with feelings
									associated with stress. Bruce Banner #3 ranges from 20-25% THC. In terms of flavor,
									you can expect strong notes of sweet strawberry and diesel. The original breeder of
									Bruce Banner #3 is Dark Horse Genetics. <br /><br />

									GSC, also known as "Girl Scout Cookies," is an indica-dominant hybrid marijuana
									strain made by crossing OG Kush with Durban Poison. This popular strain is known for
									producing euphoric effects, followed up by waves of full-body relaxation. One hit of
									GSC will leave you feeling happy, hungry, and stress-free. This strain features a
									robust THC level of 19% and is best reserved for experienced cannabis consumers.
									Those with a low THC tolerance should take it slow with GSC as the effects of the
									strain may be overwhelming. <br /><br />The high THC content in GSC is beloved by medical
									marijuana patients looking for quick relief from symptoms associated with chronic
									pain, nausea, and appetite loss. GSC is famous for its pungent, dessert-like aroma &
									flavor profile featuring bold notes of mint, sweet cherry, and lemon. The average
									price per gram of GSC is $11. According to growers, this strain flowers into green
									and purple buds with fiery orange hairs. GSC has an average flowering time of 9-10
									weeks and is a fan favorite of home grow enthusiasts. This strain has won numerous
									accolades and awards over the years, including a few Cannabis Cups. Because GSC has
									reached legendary status among the cannabis community at large, you can find many
									variations of this sought-after strain, including Thin Mint (aka Thin Mint Girl
									Scout Cookies) and Platinum GSC (aka Platinum Girl Scout Cookies).<br /><br />
