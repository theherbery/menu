									Wedding Cake, also known as "Triangle Mints #23," is a potent type of indica-hybrid
									marijuana strain made by crossing Triangle Kush with Animal Mints. Fun fact: In
									Canada, this
									strain is known as Pink Cookies. The Wedding Cake strain provides relaxing and
									euphoric
									effects that calm the body and mind.<br /><br /> This strain yields a rich and tangy
									flavor
									profile with
									undertones of earthy pepper. Medical marijuana patients choose Wedding Cake to help
									relieve
									symptoms associated with pain, insomnia and appetite loss. Consumers with a low THC
									tolerance should enjoy this strain with an extra slice of care due to its high THC
									content.
									Wedding Cake has soared in popularity over the years and was named Leafly Strain of
									the Year
									in 2019.<br /><br />

									Papaya Punch is an Indica-leaning hybrid (60% Indica and 40% Sativa) created by
									crossing
									Papaya and Purple Punch bred by Diem Farms. The strain is best known for its calming
									high desired by many users to unwind and chill after a long day. Papaya Punch has an
									average THC of 22%, but some growers have reported as high as 29% THC from this
									strain.<br /><br />
									This marijuana strain has high levels of limonene and linalool terpenes, which give
									it a
									delicious taste of sweet tropical berry. Its flavor also has a spicy note on the
									exhale.
									Papaya Punch aroma takes after its flavor. You can expect cheesy, fruity, and
									tropical
									fragrances from the buds with earthy undertones.
									Papaya Punch certainly lives up to both words of its name. Not only is it
									high-flying,
									sweet and fruity, but it packs an incredible punch, with THC levels nearing 30% on
									the
									top end. Its dominant terpenes impart a delicious tropical flavor without making you
									feel too elevated or “racy.” In fact, you will probably be heavy on this strain,
									cemented
									bodily to your big comfy couch and ready to not move for a while.<br /><br />

									Some Sativa-dominant varieties include genetics from Cinderella 99, Jack Herer, and
									Skunk #1. However, Dinafem Seeds offers an Original Amnesia, which may include
									genetics
									from Haze, Skunk No. 1, and Northern Lights.

									To make matters more confusing, an Indica-dominant variety also exists. The
									Indica-dominant herb is a cross between Bubble Gum and Super Silver
									Haze.<br /><br />

									Several other strains under the same moniker exist as well. If possible, it is
									recommended that consumers ask their budtender for information on the variety of
									this
									flower they are offering.

									As mentioned, consumers are more likely to run into a Sativa-dominant strain. A
									popular
									European strain, this is a dreamy herb that has a reputation for inspiring fits of
									hazy,
									euphoric delight.<br /><br />

									The buds of Alien Cookies are small and chunky; their color varies from bright to
									forest
									green, covered in abundance of light orange pistils, complemented by a thick coat of
									amber trichomes.

									The smell of this strain is heavy with dank, fruity, and muted vanilla notes. The
									flavor
									is surprisingly sweet, but earthy, vanilla here is very distinct, also known to have
									a
									hint of citrus. Being an evenly balanced strain, Alien Cookies is the best of both
									worlds
									(Sativa and Indica) when it comes to talking about its powerful effects.

									It is very tender in the beginning, providing users with happy, euphoric, uplifting
									experience, perfect for social events, however as the effects progress, it takes you
									into a profoundly relaxed, even sedated state. Alien Cookies is also known to invoke
									intense munchies. Several users reported it to be helpful in a condition such as
									loss of
									appetite. Novice users should take caution while using this strain, as, if taken too
									much, it takes you straight to deep sleep. This strain has an amazing ability to
									relax
									the body and calm the mind.<br /><br />

									weeks of
									flowering and brings impressive yields of 750gr/m2 indoors and up to 1000gr/plant
									outdoors. Equatorial, tropical, subtropical and temperate climates are the best for
									outside
									growing. The smoke brings unforgettable tastes of citrus and cheese and energetic,

									effects. Franco's Lemon Cheese is a good remedy for pain relieve and appetite

									G13 Haze cannabis seeds by Barney's Farm belong to a Sativa-dominant, feminized
									cannabis strain derived from the cross of the world-renowned G13 and a Hawaiian
									Sativa. The result is a vigorous, potent and easy-to-grow hybrid whose heavy-yield
									will disappoint no one.<br /><br />
									G13 Haze grows beautiful medium-sized marijuana plants with a resistant structure
									and plenty of buds overflowing with resin. It adapts perfectly to SOG and SCROG
									cultivation systems.
									The flavour and aroma of G13 Haze are intense and fruity, with hints of acid and
									touches of exotic wood as well as spices. The effect is powerful, cerebral,
									invigorating and euphoria producing. Ideal to boost creativity.<br /><br />

									The indica cannabis strain dubbed Double OG produces a scent and taste reminiscent
									of a skunky garden, being slightly sweet, a bit sour, and all with undertones of
									fresh earth. Its harvest-ready nugs are light green and lumpy, with orangey pistils
									laced throughout.<br /><br />

									THC levels of Double OG average around 22-24%, with some crops reaping in at 32%!
									Its high is known to be quite potent, so novice consumers take heed. The mind and
									body will fall into a deep relaxation that often leads to couch-lock. Functioning
									will not come easy, so ensure all important tasks of the day have been completed.
									The

									GSC, also known as "Girl Scout Cookies," is an indica-dominant hybrid marijuana
									strain made by crossing OG Kush with Durban Poison. This popular strain is known for
									producing euphoric effects, followed up by waves of full-body relaxation. One hit of
									GSC will leave you feeling happy, hungry, and stress-free. This strain features a
									robust THC level of 19% and is best reserved for experienced cannabis consumers.
									Those with a low THC tolerance should take it slow with GSC as the effects of the
									strain may be overwhelming. <br /><br />The high THC content in GSC is beloved by

									If you are searching for fragrant bud that is also crips and abundant in structure

									forward
									strain that offers a bouquet of fresh and zesty citrus fruit odours undercut by

									powerful uplifting effects. About 90% sativa, you can count on Sour D. as a stand in
									for a morning cup of coffee. It is uplifting, creative, and produces an all around
									strong high that will not trip you up. In fact, most people find that this strain
									renders a purely cerebral experience.<br /><br />

									As the high continues, it is not uncommon to need to move or feel motivated to get
									things done. It tends to be quick and focused, so if you need help meeting a
									deadline or want some help relaxing while you run errands, this Sour D. is a great
									choice. Recreational consumers will love this strain for a night out.As a
									precaution, the higher the dose, the more likely you are to feel a bit
									racy. The small amount of indica lineage may help mellow out an otherwise intense
									sativa experience. Overall, the effects of this strain are felt strongly in the head
									and
									face. Shortly after smoking or vaping, you may notice a familiar tingling in your
									sinuses and the front part of your head..<br /><br />

									Gelato 44, is a slightly indica dominant hybrid (55% indica/45% sativa) strain
									created through a cross of the infamous Sunset Sherbet X Thin Mint Girl Scout
									Cookies strains. This dank bud is infamous for its insanely delicious flavor and
									hugely powerful effects that are fueled by a THC level that hits its low point at
									20% on average. Gelato has a flavor that is said to be much like a sweet sherbet,
									with fruity blueberry and orange flavors.<br /><br /> The aroma is just as sickly
									sweet, with a
									lavender citrus berry bouquet that has a woody effect as the nugs are broken apart
									and smoked. Although it has a tasty flavor, Gelato is definitely best loved for its
									effects. Even with its slight indica dominance, the high is head heavy in nature and
									will not leave you sedated or couch-locked. It starts with a cerebral
									head rush that hits you in the forehead with an uplifted euphoria and a sense of
									slightly focused
									energy.<br /><br /> As this head high blissfully builds, a creeping body buzz will
									slowly wash
									over you, leaving you completely relaxed and calm with a sense of peace and well
									being. These powerful and surprisingly well balanced effects make Gelato the perfect

									This old school favourite Ketama Gold Hash is imported from a famous region of
									Ketama, Moroccco. The smell is fine and perfumed with a bit of a soft cocoa bean
									scent.
									There is a strong mint smell as well which would be about right if you think of all
									the
									“bursting oil” in there. The flavor is so nice and enjoyable, you wanna keep toking
									it right down to the end. The effects are somewhat subdued, relaxed and day-dreamy.
									This is a great hash to smoke for those who like the feelings of fine polms but
									yearn for something a little stronger.<br /><br />

									Rolex Hash is an Indica dominant hash originated from Morocco where it is widely
									known to produce some of the best hash in the world. This hash is quite potent but
									very easy on the throat. It smokes incredibly smooth and has a sweet and spicy taste
									to it.<br /><br />

									The THC of this product averages 42% and the high has a slow build but is
									long-lasting once it kicks in. This hash has a sweet piney aroma, with a soft and
									pliable texture and a very smooth mild to strong taste that doe not overwhelm you
									right away. This is an excellent option for those looking to ease in for a chill day
									or help fight anxiety, stress, depression, and insomnia.<br /><br />

									Its flavor is sweet and herbal, and the effects are very much true to the strains
									heavy indica effects. Within 15 seconds I felt relaxing effects start in my head
									that moved down into my body, and felt nice and medicated from one puff. Afterwards,
									I put a few more tiny pieces on top of a bubbler bowl pack of indica flower to help
									put my body in total relaxation. The effects were definitely heavy and helped me go
									to sleep fast. Theres no wonder that people have loved hash for centuries, its so
									versatile: smoke it on its own, top your flower bowl packs with it, roll it up in a
									joint, or even dab it!<br /><br />

									Blonde hash, also known as Yellow Lebanese hash, is a strain thats been around for
									centuries and is characterized by its signature yellow color. Although this strain
									originated in Lebanon, today it is used most commonly in Europe and is relatively
									rare outside of the continent. Historically, Blonde hash is famous for being one of
									the first strains used to study the potential of marijuana as an alternative form of
									medication to treat a variety of incurable ailments.<br /><br />

									As with other Lebanese hash strains, Blonde hash is produced by rubbing the
									flowering tops of mature cannabis plants carefully over a fine silk cloth. Using
									great amounts of pressure, the resulting powder is then pressed together until a
									large slab is formed. The slabs are usually very thick but can be cut and re-pressed
									easily due to their high resin content. <br /><br />

									THC distillate is a purified, solvent-free cannabis extract that has a THC levels of
									90% . Our clear golden concentrate is purged of all waxes, fats and oils during the
									filtration/distillation process using the most advanced technology to produce a pure
									thick clear oil that can be consumed as an edible, used as a topical, or
									smoked/vaporized! This is an extremely thick oil in a glass syringe. Gently warm up
									the syringe before use.<br /><br />
									The process not only creates a very pure cannabis extraction but also leaves out the
									necessity for using solvents to bind with marijuana products.
									Distilled cannabis has the highest THC content of any available concentrate, period.
									Using the short path distillation process, THC distillates are 90-99% in purity,
									miles ahead of the 15-25% range found in flowers, or the 60-80% found in BHO and Co2
									made concentrates. Frankly, the concentrate is revolutionary, given its one-two
									ultimate combo attack of going through a clean extraction process, which proves
									sustainable, and also, its high THC content, which proves to be the purest form of
									concentrates.<br /><br />

									The origin of moon rocks (the weed kind) is a bit fuzzy, but rumors abound that the
									dispensary Starbudz760 first concocted them, with legendary West Coast rapper Kurupt
									popularizing the product and trademarking his own version called Kurupt Moonrock.
									Moon rocks are a THC megazord: They are cannabis buds dipped in hash oil, then
									rolled in kief. Historically GSC is used, but any strain will suffice.<br /><br />
									Though the potency of each batch of moon rocks varies and depends on how its made
									and who produces it, the general consensus is that they hover around 50% THC. For
									reference, most flower averages around 20% THC. Each hit is damn near its own
									experience.<br /><br />
									And the high? Oh buddy, oh pal, dont even get me started on the high. Starting in
									the head and eventually spreading throughout the entire body, down to your toes, a
									moon rock high is a slow burn that will make you realize you have reached a
									mountaintop that you may not be ready to climb.<br /><br />

									GG4, formerly known as Gorilla Glue #4, developed by GG Strains, is a potent hybrid
									strain that delivers heavy-handed euphoria and relaxation, leaving you feeling
									“glued” to the couch. Its chunky, resin-covered buds fill the room with pungent
									earthy and sour aromas inherited from its parent strains, Chems Sister, Sour Dubb,
									and Chocolate Diesel. Taking first place in both the Michigan and Los Angeles 2014
									Cannabis Cups as well as the High Times Jamaican World Cup, this multiple
									award-winning hybrid's supremacy is no longer a secret, and consumers will search
									far and wide to get their hands sticky with GG4.<br /><br />
